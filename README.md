The Attendance Marking System is a project developed using Python and various libraries such as OpenCV, dlib, pandas, and Streamlit. It utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of marking attendance for students or employees.

Features :- <br>
Facial Recognition: Utilizes the dlib library for facial detection and recognition, allowing the system to identify individuals based on their facial features.<br>
Real-time Video Processing: Integrates with OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam in real-time, enabling efficient attendance tracking during live sessions.<br>
Streamlit Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a web application framework for building interactive web apps with Python. The interface displays live video feed, recognizes faces, and marks attendance seamlessly.<br>
